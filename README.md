# luamqttc - An lua mqtt client

luamqttc is base on the paho Embedded MQTT C Client Library - MQTTPacket.

This fork aims to build under luadist.

It also depends on luasocket and luasec.

Supported features:
* MQTT version v3.1.1
* Authentication
* QOS of 0, 1, 2
* Last will topic
* SSL

## Note
* To avoid 1) luasec package from luarocks repo can not load and 2) 100% cpu usage problem, you can install luasec manually from https://github.com/Yongke/luasec
* org.eclipse.paho.mqtt.embedded-c is compiled by default in little-endian byte order, to compile it in big-endian byte order, use compile flag `-DREVERSED`

## How to build

```
git clone https://github.com/Yongke/luamqttc.git
luarocks make
```

## How to run tests

Run pato mqtt testing fake broker first
```
git clone https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.testing.git
cd paho.mqtt.testing/interoperability && python3 startbroker.py
```
and then run
```
lua tests/client_test.lua
```

After the tests, quit the fake broker(CTRL + C) and you will see the coverage report.
